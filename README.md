# PowerShell-AutoClick

Automatic mouse clicker in Powershell. Watch your input, once it starts it's a real pain to turn off again. 

Maybe I'll fix that someday, who knows.

P0W3RSH3LL N00B$: Take note, you will probably need to run a special command 
in order to execute downloaded scripts:

  Set-ExecutionPolicy SignedRemote

or something like that. 

For any other questions, see google.
